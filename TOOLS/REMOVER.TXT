UNUSED DEFINITION REMOVER

This tool is a preprocessor that reads a macro assembler code and
included files, finds unused definitions of EQU (=) and STRUC, and
removes them by inserting ';UNUSED;' (comment) at the start of the
line.  This tool is useful to avoid out of memory error of the
assembler if header files contain a lot of definitions used rarely
like error codes or structures,

This tool does not remove short symbols (in case of EQU or = name
length is less than 8 characters) to avoid broken macros.
