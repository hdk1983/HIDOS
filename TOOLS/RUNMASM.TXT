RUN MASM.EXE

MASM.EXE Version 1.10 in the MS-DOS source tree looks buggy.
Depending on size of free memory, it produces unexpected out of memory
error, even if there are enough free memory.  The reason might be that
there were smaller memory than current computers when MASM 1.10 was
made.

This tool runs MASM.EXE while some memory allocated to avoid the
issue.

Note that the RUNMASM file does not have LF at end of lines.  It has
CR only to support DOSBox.

Pseudo Code
------------

Since the RUNMASM file is input for DEBUG command, it does not have
any comments.  The following is simplified pseudo code for
understanding what it does:

  set_stack_pointer(mysegment,0x1000);
  setblock(mysegment,0x1000);
  tmp=alloc(0x2000);
  alloc(number_of_largest_block());
  dealloc(tmp);
  exec("MASM.EXE",argv);
  set_stack_pointer(mysegment,0x1000);
  exit(0);
